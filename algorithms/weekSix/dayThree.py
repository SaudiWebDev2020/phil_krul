# Binary String Expansion
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# You will be given a string containing characters ‘0’, ‘1’, and ‘?’. For every ‘?’, either ‘0’ or ‘1’ characters can be substituted. Write a recursive function that returns an array of all valid strings that have ‘?’ characters expanded into ‘0’ or ‘1’.
# Ex.: binStrExpand("1?0?") should return ["1000","1001","1100","1101"]. For this challenge, you can use string functions such as slice(), etc., but be frugal with their use, as they are expensive.
